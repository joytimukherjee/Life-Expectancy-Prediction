# 📊 Life Expectancy Data Analysis

## 📘 Project Overview

This project is focused on understanding the key factors that influence **life expectancy** across various countries. Using a dataset of global life expectancy metrics, I performed extensive data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualizations to identify patterns, trends, and significant relationships among features like GDP, education, healthcare, and more.

## 🧠 Objectives

- Clean and preprocess real-world life expectancy data.
- Explore the impact of socio-economic and health factors on life expectancy.
- Visualize patterns and relationships using Python libraries.
- Derive actionable insights to support public health analysis.

## 🔁 Project Workflow

### 1. 📥 Data Collection
- Loaded the dataset from a CSV file: `Life Expectancy Data.csv`.

### 2. 🧹 Data Cleaning
- Handled missing values and outliers using Pandas and NumPy.
- Checked and corrected data types and inconsistent entries.
- Removed unnecessary columns to reduce noise.

### 3. 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Investigated distributions of key features:
  - Life expectancy
  - GDP
  - Adult mortality
  - Schooling
- Visualized data using:
  - Histograms
  - Box plots
  - Pair plots
  - Correlation heatmaps

### 4. 📈 Correlation & Statistical Insights
- Analyzed how variables like:
  - GDP
  - Schooling
  - Healthcare spending
  - Immunization rates  
  correlate with life expectancy.

### 5. 🎨 Visualization
- Used Seaborn and Matplotlib for:
  - Country-wise comparisons
  - Trend analysis over years
  - Feature interdependencies

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas & NumPy** – for data handling and manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – for data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** – for iterative development
